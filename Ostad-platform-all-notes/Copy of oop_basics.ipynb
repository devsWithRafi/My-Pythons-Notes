What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","\n","OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code.\n","\n","Think of it like this:\n","- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects (e.g., the blueprint of a car).\n","- **Object**: An instance of a class (e.g., your specific car, which was built from the blueprint).\n","\n","OOP helps organize complex programs, making them more reusable and easier to manage."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"33a215fb","metadata":{"id":"33a215fb"},"source":["## 2.
